# Password
When I saw YouTube clips of an old game show called "Million Dollar Password", I knew I wanted to make something like that.
I used Java and I used text files to store all the words for each round. The game of "Password" works like this: Basically, 
one person gives the 1-word clues and the other person guess what the "password" is. The game can be played with 2 or 4 people.
In the elimination round, players are given 30 seconds to guess 5 words based on unlimited clues.
In the million dollar password round, 3 clues are only allowed and a certain amount of words to be guessed has to be correct in order
to move on to the next round. This is a game where players would pass around the device (a computer or a phone) to play.

### Functional Requirements
This runs on **JavaSE-11** and **JDK-12.0.2**

### How to Run
Since this can only be run on the command line follow these steps:
1. Unzip the file. MAKE sure that the text files are there or the program will fail. You can modify the words to add or remove.
2. Using Command prompt or Terminal go to the directory containing the jar.
3. Run the program with java -jar Password.jar
4. Follow the instructions.

### What's Next?
As of now this only runs on the command line. I am still thinking on whether to do this as a GUI as I have done with my other projects 
or as a mobile app.
